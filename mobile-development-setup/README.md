# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the Expo Framework for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this task, ensure you have the following:
- Node.js LTS installed
- VS Code (our recommended IDE)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Expo Go installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for completing the upcoming projects efficiently.

## Expo Go Setup

### Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.

### Steps to Install Expo Go
1. **Visit the official Expo Go homepage**: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go).
2. **Select the latest SDK version** (usually automatic via the app store).
3. **Click on Install for your device**:
   - **Android**: Install from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent).
   - **iOS**: Install from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779).
4. **Open the Expo Go app** on your device.
5. **Create a new account** or log in if you already have one.
